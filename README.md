Isn't this cool? Its insane... like just glide your finger in front of the webcam and there it goes, the brush running over the canvas... filling a plain white workspace spilling the colours of your creative mind!

About its utility, it can be a great tool for the teachers while conducting online classes amid this pandemic situation. It can also be used as a local app lock method to encrypt some file or app on your PC. Can be used to generate e-sign for e-kyc and stuff. And last but not least, we can finally eradicate the use of lasers as pointing devices for presentation purposes.
